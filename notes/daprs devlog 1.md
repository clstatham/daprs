- Writing a successor to PAPR
	- I understand Rust and optimized programming much better now since working on my game engine
	- New version is much more lightweight and easier to use
- Design goals
	- Fast; focus on `Copy` types and shared references wherever possible
	- No allocations on the real-time audio thread
	- Precompute as much as possible
	- Type safety wherever possible
- 2 API levels:
	- Low-level `processor` API where raw access to audio data are available for arbitrary processing in Rust
	- High-level `builder` API for constructing signal processor graphs intuitively
		- Bindings to Lua! (Potentially Python, JS in the future)
